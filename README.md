# Approximating PI using Monte Carlo method in C#

This project is about appoximating the PI number using Monte Carlo method. If you dont know what that is, look [here](http://www.eveandersson.com/pi/monte-carlo-circle) for some theory.
The project should compile in Microsoft Visual Studio (I used 2017 version).

This is a Windows Form project; however, it uses console to communicate with a user, and the form is used only to display the graphic representation of calculations.
After turning on, the program will ask you how many iterations should it do (how many points to draw), and how wide area should it use. You can observe how approximation gets more and more accurate when you increase area or number of points.
